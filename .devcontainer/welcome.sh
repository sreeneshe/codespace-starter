# Codespaces, postStartCommand output is routed to the hidden creation log, so
# a banner there is invisible to students. postAttachCommand runs in a visible

# postAttach, it fires only after the slow `pak` install has finished — so the
# banner doubles as a genuine "setup is done" signal.

   📂  Your repo: ${repo}

   • Explorer shows ${repo}?  You're in it — commit & push via
     the Source Control panel (left).
   • If not:  File → Open Folder → /workspaces/${repo}
   • This launcher terminal stays in codespace-starter — open a
     NEW terminal (＋ above) for git/quarto commands in your repo.
