# Wired to postAttachCommand (NOT postStartCommand). This matters: in
# Codespaces, postStartCommand output is routed to the hidden creation log, so
# a banner there is invisible to students. postAttachCommand runs in a visible
# terminal, and because the lifecycle order is postCreate → postStart →
# postAttach, it fires only after the slow `pak` install has finished — so the
# banner doubles as a genuine "setup is done" signal.
#
# Note: `-u` and `pipefail` but deliberately NOT `-e`. This is a best-effort
# banner/onboarding script; a failure in the Workspace Trust config step below
# (e.g. node missing, unwritable settings) must NOT abort the script and rob the
# student of the "your Codespace is ready" banner. Steps guard themselves.

# Disable VS Code Workspace Trust for this Codespace. Without this, a repo a
# student opens via File → Open Folder starts in Restricted Mode (VS Code hasn't
# "trusted" that folder), and Restricted Mode IGNORES .vscode/settings.json — so
# the git.autofetch=false we seed there is dropped and the "run git fetch
# automatically?" prompt appears. (Same mechanism as Gemini's "untrusted folder"
# skip.) A Codespace is an isolated, managed container GitHub already auto-trusts,
# so turning the check off is safe. It's an application-scoped setting, so it must
# live in VS Code's *user* settings — it can't go in devcontainer/workspace
# settings (those are ignored for it). Idempotent: only written once.
