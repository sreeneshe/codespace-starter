#     Code Source Control panel. The panel runs git in an environment where the

#     helper would defer to that token and you'd get "Write access not granted"
#     on your own repo. So we write your personal token into git's credential
#     *store* file (which ignores env vars) and reset the helper list so the
#     store is the only helper git consults — overriding the Codespaces helper.

#     inherit — that's why the "run git fetch automatically?" prompt appeared,
#     and why the R console would otherwise fall back to the default, once you
#     open your own repo. Copy them in as this repo's own workspace settings,
#     which are always honored for this folder. Skip if the repo already has
#     settings (e.g. a returning student's repo, cloned with them committed).

# 5. Record that this student now has a work repo, so the welcome banner
#    switches from "create a project" to "here's your project." postAttachCommand
#    always runs in the codespace-starter folder, so the banner can't detect the
#    move by directory — it reads this marker instead.
echo "$repo" > "$HOME/.student_repo"

# 6. Success banner. Opening the repo as the VS Code workspace is what makes the
#    Source Control panel act on YOUR repo — but Codespaces won't let a script
#    reliably switch the workspace folder, so the dependable path is the menu.

   🎉  Created your repo: $repo   (/workspaces/$repo)

   👉 Open it:  File → Open Folder → /workspaces/$repo
      (the editor may switch on its own; if not, use that menu)

   Then, working inside your repo:
   • Save your work:    commit + push  (Source Control panel, left)
   • Publish a graphic: see .devcontainer/STUDENT_WORKFLOW.md

# 7. Best-effort: ask VS Code to switch to the new repo. Codespaces often
